# Crafting and Creating Items, Magic and otherwise

## Herbalism
![My helpful screenshot](/items.jpg)

The Herbalism Kit sounds to primarily be geared around anti-toxin (anti-poison) and Potions of healing.  Poisons are created and managed using the Poisoners kit. 

### Antitoxins: 

"A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs."

### Healing Potions

"***Brewing Potions of Healing.*** *Potions of healing* fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the herbalism kit can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table."

* 1 Day for Healing
* 1 Work Week for Greater healing
* 3 workweeks for Superior healing
* A month for Supreme healing

## Pre-requirements

To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce.

## Common Crafting Time

(Exclude Healing Potions)

"For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself."

## Magic Item Crafting Time

"An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table (half that cost for a consumable, such as a potion or scroll). A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign."

## Level Constraints for Magical Items/Potions 

* Common - 3rd Level - 100 GP
* Uncommon - 3rd Level - 500 GP
* Rare - 6th Level - 5,000 GP
* Very Rare - 11th Level - 50,000 GP
* Legendary - 17th Level - 500, 000 GP
